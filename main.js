//1. Receive button should be locked unless radio dial button has a value
//2. Research randomized code from romcom. set to a variable. tha variable will be current mantra/affirma
//3. If (affirmation then choose me a random on button click
//4. If (mantra then chose me a random on a button click
// For loop
//5.will need an anonymous function in the event listener so you can run other functions inside of it.
