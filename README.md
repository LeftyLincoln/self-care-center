# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

1. I built a working website where you can enter, and choose whether you want to see a random affirmation or mantra. This website also features the ability to enter your own affirmation or mantra in, and have it added to the array of them. When you cycle through the list, your new one will pop up! This app is solving the problem, giving me a bit of hope and joy, when they come vist by delivering a simple but inspring message to anyone who visits. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. A person could fork my github, and then run git clone (ssh code) which you can find on github inside the green code button. From there they could cd into the directory and run code . to open vs code.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

1. https://gist.github.com/LeftyLincoln/ece06794e23608144ca52f47dbbbe077

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

1. Our project was assigned Tuesday evening and we had until Sunday evening at 9pm MT to finish it. I am now through my third week of Mod 1. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

1. This was a solo project worked on by me, Travis Parks. I can be found at https://github.com/LeftyLincoln

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

1. The goals of this project were to gain some experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript all in coordination with each other. We wanted to use HTML and CSS specifically to try and match a given comp. I think another aspect was to give us some free reign to allow our creativity and individuality to flourish a bit. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins
1. I started this project off better, and felt comfortable using HTML and then adding some CSS to it.
2. I felt almost a flow going through the CYOA part, which has not been the case for me often. So that was a big win. 

#### Challenges
1. I would create some functionality, which would then affect some other part. So it was challenging to work methodically to fix each part of the pie if you will. 
2. I struggled with the CSS flex getting my containers the way I wanted them, and understanding which parts were controlling the boxes and which ones I need to style. I will plan on practicing this more and more over break.
